    <h1>Resume</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
      I'm <strong>Nurul Anis</strong>, a fresh graduate from Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). From the very start of my studies in Game Technology, I was driven by a passion to blend programming skills with creative design. 
      Throughout my time at UTeM, I worked on various interactive digital projects, including developing custom tools for environmental data monitoring and visualization. 
      These experiences challenged me to think critically, explore innovative solutions, and strengthened my abilities in programming, multimedia systems, and UI/UX design.
      <br />
      <br />Now, as I step into the professional world, Iâ€™m excited to bring both my technical expertise and creativity to real-world projects. 
      While programming remains a core passion, Iâ€™m equally enthusiastic about taking on any technical-related tasks that allow me to learn, grow, and contribute. I am committed to continuous improvement and eager to be part of the ever-evolving tech and digital innovation industry.
      <br />
      <br />This is just the beginning of my journey, and I look forward to the opportunities ahead where I can make a meaningful impact. If thereâ€™s any opportunity, feel free to
